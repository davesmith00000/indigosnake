# Snake!

Long before Candy Crush, we wasted our lives on Snake!

## What is this?

This is a straightforward implementation of Snake, used to help work out the requirements for a Scala / Scala.js game engine that presents a purely functional interface.

If anyone's wondering, I have made a few versions of this with more elaborate graphics and different mechanics, but honestly it's hard to do better than the 90's Nokia version ...which this isn't as good as!
